Change Log
----------

0.2.1:
- Wait one second before starting DockbarX to prevent wonkiness.
- Move the plug program out of $PREFIX/bin because there's no point letting users start it outside of the plugin. On the downside... the path to that program is hardcoded, and will only go into /usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins. I could never figure out how to get Vala defines to work in waf.
- This version is uploaded to github so others can file issues and make changes. This is no longer my baby. It is yours now, community. Raise it well. :')

0.2:
- True version that doesn't do everything in the most terrible way possible.
  "If you can't determine it gracefully, ask the user." That is a good
  programming rule.
- The DBX plug reads all configuration info from the RC file as opposed to
  having it communicated over the command line.
- Presents the configuration dialog at first run to allow the user to configure
  background styling.
- Automatically detects orientation and screen position, and communicates them
  to the DBX plug.
- Still just rudely kills off the plug whenever a configuration change occurs,
  but it works so I'm not gonna fix it.

0.1:
- Initial version with all significant functionality implemented.
