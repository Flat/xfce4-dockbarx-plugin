xfce4-dockbarx-plugin, v0.3.1
-----------------------------

xfce4-dockbarx-plugin is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file. For
information on the authors of this program, see AUTHORS and THANKS.

xfce4-dockbarx-plugin is a pair of programs, one in Vala and one in Python, that
work together to embed DockbarX into xfce4-panel. See THANKS for details on
DockbarX. Because this is not a port and just grabs the pre-existing DockbarX,
you immediately benefit from any updates made to DBX, and already have all the
pre-existing functionality.

The old version of this plugin tried to blend in with the panel, and due to
limitations with the Vala bindings for Xfconf, could only blend in with panel-0.
You were pretty much out of luck if panel-0 didn't exist.

The new version uses manual configuration to determine background styling.
When you first start the plugin, a dialog will appear that will allow you to
configure the way the background is drawn. You can then configure it to blend
in with the panel it's on... or you can even choose for it *not* to blend in!
Since you can choose for it not to blend in, you can also expand it if you want.
The plugin will automatically detect panel orientation and screen position, and
communicates this info to the python DBX plug. Whenever the configuration is
changed, the plug is restarted.

This plugin includes a DockbarX theme called Mouse, created by me for use with
xfce4-panel (but should work fine on Gnome/Mate panels, AWN, or DockX). There
are two variant versions for varying levels of x/ythickness on the panel widgets
to make them match up nicely. If a theme gives panel widgets differing
x/ythickness, its author is a sick bastard.

Enjoy using DockbarX on Xfce! :)
